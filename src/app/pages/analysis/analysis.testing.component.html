        <div id='key-takeaway'><p>A casual glance at positive tests in Ontario suggests the curve is relatively flat.
            Doubling time (not shown) has been decreasing. But a deeper analysis shows that delays in test results are
            piling up, producing an artificial decrease in the number of confirmed cases. Approximately 25% of cases are
            unreported.<br><br> Additionally, <a href='https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus#section-8'>
                Ontario is not testing all patients with flu like symptoms </a>. Even with rigorous testing, we know
            from Wuhan that there are approximately 10 symptomatic cases for each positive test. Ontarioâ€™s ratio is
            likely even higher.</p>
