            <p>A casual glance at positive tests in Ontario suggests the curve is relatively flat.
                Doubling time (not shown) has been decreasing. But a deeper analysis shows that delays in test results
                are
                piling up, producing an artificial decrease in the number of confirmed cases. Approximately 25% of cases
                are
                unreported.<br><br> Additionally, <a

                    Ontario is not testing all patients with flu like symptoms </a>. Even with rigorous testing, we know
                from Wuhan that there are approximately 10 symptomatic cases for each positive test. Ontarioâ€™s ratio is
                likely even higher.</p>
