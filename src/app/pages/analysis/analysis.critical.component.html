         <div id='key-takeaway'><p>Once critical care (ICU) beds run out, mortality rate jumps from 1% to 5%. The Critical Care capacity map (top graph) shows the % of remaining adult ICU beds in each Local Health Integration Network (LHIN). Some hospitals have created new surge ICU capacity (for example, operating rooms), which is not reflected here. Darker shades indicate a region that is closer to reaching 100% ICU capacity. Hover over a region to see what percentage of ICU beds are occupied, and the exact count of beds remaining. </p> 

         <p><strong>Almost all regions have hit at least 50% critical care capacity, with many approaching 100%.</strong></p> 

        <p>The Critical Care Capacity Breakdown bar chart (middle graph) illustrates how the critical care capacity is split in each region. The blue bar represents the percentage of critical care beds in use by non-COVID patients.</p>

         <p><strong>Before COVID, the blue bars would have nearly filled capacity; hospital activities to lower the blue bars (for example by decreasing elective surgeries requiring ICU follow up care) have helped create surge capacity.</strong></p> 

         <p>The remaining coloured segments reflect COVID-related cases. Red bars show percent of confirmed COVID patients in critical care, and yellow bars show patients suspected of having COVID. Green bars show patients with a confirmed negative COVID diagnosis. Cycle through the time windows on the top right to see how critical care beds have filled since CCSO started reporting data.</p> 
        
        <p>Exact counts of remaining resources are shown in the Residual Beds and Ventilators bar chart (bottom graph). Hover to see the counts. A negative number indicates that cases have exceeded conventional space and likely surged into non-conventional ICU spaces.</p>
