## What to know before starting?
We want to harness the power of various COVID-19 data and modelling outputs with experts in software development, epidemiology, public health, medicine, machine learning, and data visualization to rapidly create outputs for Ontario’s public health experts, health systems decision-makers and  government leaders to flatten the curve. 

## Our objectives:
1) Build a collaborative multidisciplinary community of top data scientists and engineers from academia and industry to support Ontario’s response to COVID-19;
2) Building a single, open data warehouse for datasets related to COVID-19 in Ontario, to compare with analyses and NPIs from around the world;
3) Build an open analytics platform to allow academic and industry collaboration on analyses to support rapid, data-driven decision-making for our health system;
4) Build a single site collating and visualizing all Ontario-relevant analyses in an easy-to-interpret manner for health systems decision-makers.
